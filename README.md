This is a basic template for a React application using es6 and Webpack for bundling. 

To run this, clone the repository, makes sure npm is installed on your system and run

 npm install

to install all the dependent packages, then 

 npm run build

to transpile and bundle.

And then open public\index.html in a browser. If all went well, you should see a page that displays Hello World.
