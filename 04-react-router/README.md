# 04-react-router

Adds:
- react-router
- react-bootstrap-router
- connected-react-router

This adds a menu bar on top that uses a react router that is connected to the redux store.

Please note that I've dropped the public directory and moved the dist directory up. index.html now lives in the dist directory.
